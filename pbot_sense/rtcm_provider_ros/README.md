# ROS2 package for RTCM Provider 

This package aims to enable the publication of RTCM data from various sources (currently, only direct NTRIP server source) for RTK applications in ROS2.
Additionally, the package offers the functionality to reselect the RTCM base station for direct NTRIP server source. 
At present, it only supports RTCM base stations located in Korea (at www.gnssdata.or.kr).

## TODO
- Support rtcm source from external device.
